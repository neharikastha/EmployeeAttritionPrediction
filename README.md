# Employee Attrition Prediction Using Python and Machine Learning
This is a project for AI/ML bootcamp hosted by KEC IT Club.

This project involves building a neural network model to predict employee attrition (whether an employee leaves the company) based on a variety of factors such as age, years worked, and monthly income and more.

# Features
* Data Preprocessing:  Clean and prepare the dataset for machine learning.

* Model Training: Train machine learning models using various algorithms like Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, KNN Classifier, GaussianNB Classifier.

* Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.

* Prediction: Make predictions on new data using trained models.

# Installation
### Prerequisites
The following must be installed:
* Python 3.12 (recommended)
* Jupyter notebook (if you want to train yourself)
* git 
* VS Code (recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neharikastha/AI-ML_bootcamp.git
    ```
2. Navigate to your project directory
    ```bash
    cd AI-ML_bootcamp
    ```
3. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirement.txt
    ```
# To run the predictor
* This model is pre-trained. Run app.py file on the terminal to start the prediction.

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
* Open your web browser and go to  `http://localhost:8501/` to access the application.

# If you want to train the model on your own:

1. **Install Anaconda** : Install anaconda. Once installed, jupyter notebook is installed automatically.

2. **Open the Anaconda prompt** : Navigate to the directory where `EmployeeAttrition.ipynb` is located using your terminal.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/the/directory
    ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook : Run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
